Description: Description: Implements the Interval-Censored Sequence Kernel Association test for testing the association between interval-censored time-to-event outcomes and groups of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when considering competing risks. Interval-censored time-to-event data occur when the event time is not known exactly but can be deduced to fall within a given interval. This package also implements the competing risks interval-censored Burden test.
